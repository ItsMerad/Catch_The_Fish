# 🐠 Catch The Fish 🎣

A simple and fun fish-catching game!

This project is a basic 2D game developed using the Java programming language, where players try to catch as many fish as possible. "Catch The Fish" demands quick reflexes and strategy, offering an enjoyable experience with its user-friendly interface and core gameplay mechanics.




## ✨ Features
-Simple Gameplay: Basic mechanics controlled by mouse or keyboard.

-Diverse Objects: Catchable fish and harmful objects to avoid (e.g., old shoe, leaf).

-Sound Effects: Simple in-game sounds that enhance interaction.

# 🚀 Setup and Running
Setting up and running this project on your local machine is quite straightforward.

## Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or newer: Required to compile and run the project.

### Steps

Clone the Repository:
First, download the project's source code to your computer. Open your terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and run the following command:

```bash 
  git clone https://github.com/ItsMerad/Catch_The_Fish.git
```
Navigate to the Project Folder:
Change your current directory to the main project folder you just cloned:

```bash 
  cd Catch_The_Fish
```
Run the Game:
The project is packaged as a .jar file and can be run directly.

```bash 
  java -jar CatchTheFish.jar

```
If CatchTheFish.jar is not found, you might need to check inside the out/Catch_The_Fish/ directory or follow the build steps through NetBeans IDE.

# Lessons Learned
Developing the 'Catch The Fish' game was a rewarding experience, providing valuable insights into various aspects of Java development, game mechanics, and version control. Here are some key lessons I learned throughout this project:

### Basic Game Development Principles in Java
Developing a simple game from scratch offered practical understanding of core game development concepts:

- Event Handling: Implementing user input (mouse/keyboard) and game events (catching a fish, collision detection) was a key learning curve.

- Game Loop & Timing: Understanding how to manage the game's state updates and rendering cycles to ensure smooth gameplay.

- Resource Management: Handling image and audio assets, ensuring they are loaded and used efficiently.

- Simple UI Design: Creating a functional and user-friendly graphical interface with Java Swing/AWT components.
